# Blog machinery back up

The downside of running a (slightly) custom[^yakshave] version of
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is that it can break when things get
updated. Somewhere around 2022 or 2023 I noticed that the `pikchr`
diagrams weren't rendering properly when I tried to regenerate my site.

Well, yesterday, I finally got around to fixing it, mainly so that I
can write some posts to properly document my experience playing around
with ESP32-C3 chips and Adafruit Neopixels.

[^yakshave]: modified to run pikchr in goldmark as described in
    [gopikchr: a yakshave](/2022/01/gopikchr-a-yakshave/)
