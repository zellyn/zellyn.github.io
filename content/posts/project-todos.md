In an effort to organize the many side-projects I would *like* to do
&mdash; at least in my mind &mdash but probably never will, I created
a <a href="/page/projects/todo/">Projects: TODO</a> page.

I've never collaborated much on side projects. If something strikes
your fancy, I would *love* to work together.
