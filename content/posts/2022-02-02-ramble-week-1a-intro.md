# Questions for week 1

<br/>
<table style="border:1px solid lightgrey;"><td>

- When you say `a = "Hello, world"` in your favorite language, how is
  the string stored? How about `"Hello, 世界"`?
- When you say `a = "Hello"` and `b = " world"` and then do `c = a +
  b`, what happens? How are `a`, `b`, and `c` stored?
- When you say `a = 42`, and then `b = a`, and then `b = 17`, what are
  `a` and `b`? Why?
- When you say `a = {"foo": 42}`, and then `b = a`, and then `b.foo =
  17`, what are `a` and `b`? Why?
- Why do computer people use “foo” and “bar” all the time? What’s up
  with that? What about 42 and 17?

_We'll start discussing how memory is laid out and used to represent
numbers and text in the [next part](../1b/)._
