# Intro

It turns out we have several folks at Square who arrived at
programming through boot-camps, or other non-CS paths, and feel a sort
of lingering insecurity (or get explicitly told by unkind people) that
their path left them without a solid grasp of “the fundamentals”.

I have the pleasure of having a boot-camp grad on our team, [Amy
Henning](https://amyh.dev/): she's now several tech jobs in (and
fantastically capable), and has a really great perspective on what our
industry can be like to people coming in from outside.

We decided to try an experiment for folks in our company interested in
learning CS: I'll play the grizzled veteran, and come up with
provocative questions, and we'll meet for an hour every two weeks and
discuss them. I'm excited to see how it goes!
