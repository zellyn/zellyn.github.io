# Intro

It turns out we have several folks at Square who arrived at
programming through boot-camps, or other non-CS paths, and feel a sort
of lingering insecurity (or get explicitly told by unkind people) that
their path left them without a solid grasp of “the fundamentals”.

I have the pleasure of having a boot-camp grad on our team, [Amy
Henning](https://amyh.dev/): she's now several tech jobs in (and
fantastically capable), and has a great perspective on what our
industry can be like to people coming in from outside.

We decided to try an experiment for folks in our company interested in
learning CS: I'll play the grizzled veteran, and come up with
provocative questions, and we'll meet for an hour every two weeks and
discuss them. I'm excited to see how it goes!

## Encouragement

As mentioned above, the genesis of this ramble was trying to fill in
the gaps that cause bootcamp grads to feel shaky. There's an
interesting (and hopefully encouraging) thing about the stuff we're
going to cover: for many of the concepts, after learning, thinking,
and chatting about them for an hour or two, you'll be more comfortable
with them than many working programmers!

For every CS grad who spent entire classes working with 1s and 0s,
desigining circuits to add and manipulate binary numbers, there are
two more programmers who've spent years working with simple web apps,
and never learned---or don't remember---how to twiddle bits. Even a
hand-wavy understanding of how the processor's use of memory affects
the speed at which your program executes will put you ahead of the
40%[^1] of all programmers for whom the CPU is just a complete
mystery.

[^1]: 83% of all statistics are made up on the spot[^2].

[^2]: Yes, including this one.
