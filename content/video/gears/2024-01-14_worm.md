## Intro
{{< ts "0:00" >}}

Worm gears transmit power between non-intersecting shafts, and achieve
a very high gear reduction ratio in a very compact space.

## Modeling the worm
{{< ts "0:15" >}}

Think of the worm as a rack that has been revolved around an axis,
except the teeth are revolved around in a helix instead of in circles.


### Parameters
{{< ts "0:45" >}}

|                       | &nbsp; |      |
|-----------------------|--------|------|
| \(module\)            |        | 2mm  |
| \(length\) (in teeth) |        | 10   |
| \(pressure angle\)    |        | 20°  |
| \(starts\)            |        | 4    |
| \(diameter\)          |        | 40mm |



### New component: worm
{{< ts "1:06" >}}

### New sketch on the vertical (xz) plane
{{< ts "1:14" >}}

This sketch looks much like the sketch in the [rack
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0TYejSjE-E):

```pikchr
A: line thin right 1
X1: line thin color gray down 50% from 2mm below A.w
X2: line thin color gray down 50% from 2mm below A.e
text "diameter" "2" at (1/2<X1,X2>,6/8<X1.start,X1.end>)
line thin from 2mm right of previous text.w to 2mm left of previous text.e
line thin color gray from previous text.w left until even with X1 ->
line thin color gray from previous text.e right until even with X2 ->

B: line from A.w up 2
line thin color gray left 70% from 2mm left of B.n
line same from 2mm left of B.s
text "length ×" "module ×" "π" at (7/8<previous.start,previous.end>,1/2<B.n,B.s>)
line thin color gray from previous text.n up until even with B.n ->
line thin color gray from previous text.s down until even with B.s ->
```

### Sweep
{{< ts "1:45" >}}

Surface → Sweep, of type "Single Path"

| | &nbsp; | |
|-|-|-|
|**profile**| | horizontal line |
|**path**| |vertical line|
|**twist angle**| | \( length / starts \times 360°   \) |

The only part we're interested in is that outer helical path. Since we
want to have a total length of 10 teeth, and four starts, each start
will twist 2½ times.

### Tooth profile
{{< ts "2:38" >}}

Create a sketch on the vertical (xz) plane, and project in the
horizontal line we used for the sweep profile, so we can align the
tooth profile with it.

{{< ts "2:57" >}}

The tooth profile itself is just a trapezoid drawn with lines and several constraints.

```pikchr

A: line go 1 heading 110;
B: line go down 0.5;
C: line go 1 heading 250
D: line to first line.start

E: line from 3/5 <A.start, A.end> \
  to 2/5 <C.start, C.end>
dot at E

X1: line thin color gray from 2mm below D.start then down 50%
X2: line thin color gray from 2mm below E.end then down until even with last line.end
X3: line thin color gray from 5.4mm below B.end then down until even with last line.end
X4: line thin color gray from 4mm right of E.start then right 0.8
X5: line thin color gray from 4mm right of E.end then right 0.8

 then go 0.5 heading 20

text at 0.7mm heading 20 from last.end "pitch line" ljust small

```

### Helical sweep

{{< ts "3:50" >}}

Solid → Sweep → "path + guide rail sweep"

The profile is the tooth profile we just drew, the path is the
vertical line, and the guide rail is the helix. (Make sure "chain
selection" is off when selecting these.)

This gives us a single start for the worm gear:

Go into the worm gear, and hide the unneeded surface body.

Select our sweep and do a circular pattern with Object type
