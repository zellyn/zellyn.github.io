## Summary

I'm an expert at backend distributed systems, micro-services, Go, and Developer Experience. I am looking for a role with impact, where I can help bring clarity and success to your complex projects.

## Work Experience

### Square / Block — Sep 2015–Mar 2025
#### Staff Engineer (Block "L7")

<br>

_Frameworks Team: IC — 2023–2025_
- Member of Square's *Technical Governance Review Board*, reviewing and approving Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for core technology selection and retirement.
- Plumbed W3C Trace-Context and Baggage through all three frameworks, using OpenTelemetry code-level APIs, enabling traffic diversion to developer microservice instances buried in the RPC call graph.
- Worked with Network, Deployment, Data/Security/Governance teams and AWS Solutions Architect to migrate `sftp` and `fpts` server functionality to the cloud, ultimately removing one of the last barriers to the full Cloud Migration.

_Frameworks Team: Manager — 2019–2023_
- Founded, grew, and managed the Frameworks team (5→11 engineers) focused on maintaining and improving core server Frameworks across Go, Java, and Ruby.
- Positioned our team to be critical in the Cloud Migration, working at first to ensure framework compatibility with AWS EKS, and later to develop the process of migrating apps _without code changes._
- Architected and led a migration to LaunchDarkly for 20,000+ feature flags, and worked closely with LaunchDarkly to evolve their capabilities to match our scale. This unlocked much safer flag flips, including metrics-gated changes and first-class Segments, again _without application-level code changes._

_Payments Platform: IC — 2016–2019_
- Implemented backend components for Apple Pay and MasterPass integration, focusing on payment gateway communication, allowing Square merchants to support Apple Pay.
- Worked on Chargebacks, documentation, and continuing to steward Go.

_Shared Systems: IC — 2015–2016_
- Led Go infrastructure development across Square, assuming responsibility for the Go server framework.
- Ported service-to-service retry logic, ensuring that Go applications had parity with Java applications, and allowing developers to reason coherently about retry behavior.
- Unforked a complex and messy internal version of `protobuf`/`protoc`, making upgrades and security patches possible.


### YouTube — Aug 2010–Aug 2015
#### Software Engineer III, Abuse Engineering

- Led development of the client attestation system to verify legitimate YouTube clients reducing automated abuse.
- Built system to score comments for similarity within a 40-minute sliding window, reducing comment abuse.
- Implemented system to identify and discount spammy subscriptions from channel counts.
- Received YouTube Engineering Code Excellence Award alongside two teammates for outstanding technical contributions.
- Ported anomaly detection code to Go, built monitoring dashboards, and implemented slideshow detection algorithms.


### Cox Media Group Digital — Nov 2009–Jul 2010
#### Manager, Software Development

- Led team of five developers participating in building a custom CMS platform for 120+ TV, radio, and newspaper websites.
- Drove technical decision to adopt Python/Django for new CMS development.
- Designed and implemented v1 of the distributed identity system.
- Established Kanban-based Agile development processes focused on flow and cycle time optimization.

### Atlanta Journal-Constitution — Oct 2007–Nov 2009
#### Sr. Web Developer

- Co-designed and implemented new User Registration system with Django integration.
- Developed web applications for data presentation/reporting including executive pay, election results, and Georgia names.
- Built internal tools for news alerts and contest creation, significantly reducing client workload.
- Improved development processes through BuildBot implementation for continuous integration.


### Northrop Grumman Mission Systems — Mar 2003–Oct 2007
#### Software Engineer 4

- Designed and implemented search infrastructure for CDC.gov using Verity and Google Search Appliance.
- Rewrote content inventory backend process, converting from Perl to Java and implementing incremental updates that reduced run time by an order of magnitude.
- Developed enterprise vocabulary solutions working with ontology experts and CDC vocabulary sponsors.


### Sapient Corporation — Oct 1999–Feb 2003
#### Associate, Technology

- Implemented CMS search functionality for UPS.com, integrating Interwoven CMS with Lucene search engine.
- Designed and built discussion boards and online calendaring for cancer.org (American Cancer Society).

## Skills
- *Understanding complex systems*: A desire to understand drives me to investigate and document complex systems and tacit knowledge.
- *Languages*: Strong in Go, Python, Java. Ok with Javascript. Comfortable with anything.
- *Feature Flags*: Ask me anything. I have a lot of experience with home-grown solutions, with LaunchDarkly, and with
  what it takes to migrate from one to the other.
- *Infrastructure and Observability*: AWS, DataDog, Docker, GRPC, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, Protobufs, Terraform, Tilt.
- *Miscellaneous*: Bazel, CLI tools, DynamoDB, Git (+Jujutsu), Guice, Infrastructure as Code, MySQL, Documentation for humans and AI agents.
- *Specialties*: Microservices, distributed system design, observability, framework development and maintenance, Developer Experience, teaching and mentoring.
- *Long, sweeping migrations*: Much of my work in recent years has been in Developer Experience or Platforms, doing long, involved migrations, minimizing impact on product-focused developers.

## Side Projects

- Developed [`gocool`](http://github.com/zellyn/gocool) (compiler), [`go6502`](http://github.com/zellyn/go6502) (CPU emulator), and [`goapple2`](http://github.com/zellyn/goapple2) (Apple II emulator), as well as [`a2audit`](http://github.com/zellyn/a2audit) tests used by most new emulator authors.
- Contributed to various open source projects in the Go ecosystem.
- Ported [Pikchr](https://pikchr.org/) (SQLite team's modern PIC implementation) to Go ([`gopikchr`](https://github.com/gopikchr/gopikchr)), and integrated it with the Goldmark markdown engine and Hugo static site generator.

## Interested in
- *CRDTs*: I would love to get a chance to gain deep working experience with CRDTs.
- *AI agents*: if you're measurably improving autonomous coding in complex, tech-debt-heavy codebases, I'd love to help.
- *Feature flags*: At this point, I know enough to design a flag delivery system from scratch, and it might be fun!
- *Location*: Remote, in-office in Atlanta, or (ideally), something where both are possible.

## Education

### Georgia Institute of Technology — Aug 1994–Jun 1998
#### BSc. in Computer Science
