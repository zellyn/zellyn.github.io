<li>Plumbed W3C Trace-Context and Baggage through all three frameworks, using OpenTelemetry code-level APIs, enabling traffic diversion to developer microservice instances buried in the RPC call graph.</li>
<li>Worked with Network, Deployment, Data/Security/Governance teams and AWS Solutions Architect to migrate <code>sftp</code> and <code>fpts</code> server functionality to the cloud, ultimately removing one of the last barriers to the full Cloud Migration.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Frameworks Team: Manager — 2019–2023</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Founded, grew, and managed the Frameworks team (5→11 engineers) focused on maintaining and improving core server Frameworks across Go, Java, and Ruby.</li>
<li>Positioned our team to be critical in the Cloud Migration, working at first to ensure framework compatibility with AWS EKS, and later to develop the process of migrating apps <em>without code changes.</em></li>
<li>Architected and led a migration to LaunchDarkly for 20,000+ feature flags, and worked closely with LaunchDarkly to evolve their capabilities to match our scale. This unlocked much safer flag flips, including metrics-gated changes and first-class Segments, again <em>without application-level code changes.</em></li>

<ul>
<li>Led Go infrastructure development across Square, assuming responsibility for the Go server framework.</li>
<li>Ported service-to-service retry logic, ensuring that Go applications had parity with Java applications, and allowing developers to reason coherently about retry behavior.</li>
