<h2 id="direct-attacks">Direct attacks</h2>
<p>I remember<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> reading a post where someone gave their infosec-savvy
friend permission to hack them. They’d owned their home router within
a day or two, and a short time later managed to leverage an
improperly-secured software update in their editor to pop up an alert
declaring victory. Owned.</p>
<p>The basic rule for us non-notable individuals when it comes to
electronic security has been that you don’t want to be the low-hanging
fruit. You want to avoid falling victim to low-effort, low cost,
large-scale automated attacks. Accept that if someone who really knows
what they’re doing decides to directly target you, you’re toast, but
be glad you’re not that important. Install updates promptly. Use a
password manager. Don’t click suspicious links. Don’t install cracked
apps from bittorrent. Keep your router firmware updated. Use the
crappy router your internet provider gave you only to talk to another
router that actually runs your network. etc.</p>
<p>As the inimitable James Mickens put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the real world, threat models are much simpler […]. Basically,
you’re either dealing with Mossad or not-Mossad. If your
adversary is not-Mossad, then you’ll probably be fine if you pick
a good password and don’t respond to emails from
<a href="mailto:ChEaPestPAiNPi11s@virus-basket.biz.ru">ChEaPestPAiNPi11s@virus-basket.biz.ru</a>. If your adversary is the
Mossad, YOU’RE GONNA DIE AND THERE’S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>So… what happens when AI Agents reach “someone who really knows what
they’re doing” levels? What happens when they’re cheap enough to have
a server in a datacenter, running an offensive infosec-savvy AI
individually targeting <em>you</em>? We’re in trouble!</p>
<h2 id="long-term-social-engineering">Long-term social engineering</h2>
<p>Sure, there are worrying stories popping up about AI deep-fakes being
used in Zoom calls to impersonate corporate superiors and authorize
money transfers. There’s also medium-term fake long-distance
relationships recently
<a href="https://www.bentasker.co.uk/posts/blog/security/seducing-a-romance-scammer.html">described so compellingly by Ben Tasker</a>.</p>
<p>But what I’m worried about is the long game. I think we’ve all heard
of “pig butchering” scams by now, where someone plays the really long
game, willing to spend years building a fake long-distance
relationship, and only eventually cashing out.</p>
<p>I’m probably not the type to get hooked by the prospect of a
relationship with a poor but beautiful and surprisingly educated young
woman desperate to escape a third-world country and stay at home
making me a martini every evening as we reenact some imaginary 1950s
home life and dysfunctional power dynamic. But I’ll tell you what
probably <em>would</em> work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Out of the blue, <a href="mailto:jo@example.com">jo@example.com</a> sends a couple of small doc fixup
PRs to one of my Apple II emulation-related github
repos. Huh. Nobody really uses that code but me (hopefully!), but I
guess they ran across it and were interested. Thanks! Merged!</p>
<p>A few months later, I get pinged in the <code>#emulators</code> channel of the
Apple II enthusiast Slack. Someone named Jo is building an
emulator. Sounds vaguely familiar? They have a question about my
<code>a2audit</code> tests. Does the language card <em>really</em> work that way? They
joke about how long the CPU emulation took them, but that looking at
my 6502 code was useful. Aah, that’s why they were looking! Don’t
worry, I encourage, it took us <em>all</em> forever! And get ready to read
your Sather with the diligence of a Talmud scholar.</p>
<p>They follow me on BlueSky, and some months later, on LinkedIn. Ooh,
they have some neat articles about signed distance fields on their
blog. I add their RSS feed. They post infrequently, but it’s always
interesting. And they’ve got some neat computational art stuff on
github. Written in Elm! Respect!</p>
<p>We chat on and off. They put their kid in touch with me—they’re
interested in attending Georgia Tech, and would like to chat with
someone who went there, even if it was in the 1900s. They don&rsquo;t end
up attending, but I enjoy the advice/nostalgia.</p>
<p>One day, they mention an
idle-ant/cookie-clicker/universal-paperclips-style game they’ve been
working on to learn Swift, but with a retro vibe: would I like to
try it out and give them feedback? Oh heck yes! It’s not
cross-platform yet, but we work together and eventually manage to
get it to run on my personal Mac. I feel glad I could help; they
don’t have a Mac to test on. It’s cute. I give them feedback, and
they make some tweaks. Sometimes you have to wait a long time to
earn crystals, so I fire up <code>caffeine</code> to leave it running all day
while I’m at work, accruing those sweet, exponential gems. That
reminds me, I should check my brokerage account, see how things are
doing, move some money over before I leave for work…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m afraid we’re not ready for this.</p>
<p>We humans will anthropomorphize a washing machine, given half a
chance. Something that can show personality, creativity, and even
intonation and emotion in voice chat? We’re done. It’s been a good
run, folks, time to pack it in!</p>
<p>Or perhaps sufficiently advanced spam is indistinguishable from a
useful service offered at a reasonable price—like if the Google search
ads turn out to be what you wanted, or if the sketchy Canadian
pharmaceutical company sends you the right drugs! Like, “I’m 99% sure
my dad is in a relationship with an LLM, but he’s the happiest he’s
been in years. I’ve limited the money he has access to, and if he
occasionally wires off $200 to get the satisfaction of “helping”,
honestly, so far it’s completely worth it to see him so alive.”</p>
<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h2>
<p>Hell if I know.</p>
<p>On the technical side, it’s probably long past time we stop running
operating systems written in C and without bulletproof sandboxing. It
would be nice if our home routers weren’t all asking to be hacked, and
if I could safely run an unknown binary on my laptop. I was hoping
Fuchsia would be the ticket, but Google has the attention span of a
goldfish that just successfully submitted its promo packet. I
dunno. <a href="https://www.redox-os.org/">Redox</a>? Rustaceans adopt <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2024/08/30/2024-08-30-Rust-in-Linux-revisited.html">Drew

Linux itself adds
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">enough</a>
Rust?</p>
<p>On the emotional side? Not sure. I guess at some point, defensive AIs
will be a thing. We worry about the vulnerability of aging parents
when we can’t be there helping them be careful 100% of the time—what
if an AI <em>could</em> be there? What if I have my own defensive infosec
expert? Maybe we start using dedicated hardened devices for banking,
like with bitcoin wallets? Suggestions welcome!</p>

<p>This was actually written without the help of an AI. When I asked
Claude for suggestions, it wanted to clickbait it up something fierce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider starting with a more attention-grabbing hook. While your
opening is good, you might directly state the paradigm shift: &ldquo;The
old rules of personal cybersecurity are about to become obsolete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Your current title works, but you might consider something with more
urgency or specificity, like &ldquo;AI Agents: When Everyone Has Their Own
Personal Hacker&rdquo; or &ldquo;The End of &lsquo;Good Enough&rsquo; Security: Preparing
for AI-Powered Threats.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, “The end of Good Enough Security” is annoyingly good.
Dammit, Claude: you can have the subtitle. <em>I, for one, welcome our new
AI overlords…</em></p>
