    </header><p>Sometimes, you just get sick of not knowing how things work, and you
have to take a little &ldquo;structured procrastination&rdquo; side-quest, current
assigned task be damned. This is an idiosyncratic view: I mostly
focused on tools that tend to get mentioned at my company, and this is
not my area. But I think there are nonetheless some useful ideas it
would be worth communicating.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>There are currently 900 startups with indistinguishable landing pages
that all say something like, &ldquo;Infrastructure as code for your
Kubernetes clusters, done right.&rdquo; The whole space is a mess, and
hasn&rsquo;t settled down yet. Not only have clear winners not emerged, but
it doesn&rsquo;t even seem that a clear <em>model</em> has emerged. How to think
about the space?</p>
<h2 id="declarative-vs-imperative">Declarative vs Imperative</h2>
<p>In the old times, a cool infrastructure tool let you run bash scripts
on a thousand hosts at once. And when they broke on 23 machines
you&hellip; well, either ran them again (hope every step was safe to
re-run!), or wrote <em>another</em> script to fix things, or went and fixed
them one by one.</p>
<p>Things got more declarative: instead of specifying a list of steps,
try to specify the shape you&rsquo;d like the resulting world to be in, and
let the tool pick the steps to get there. Instead of &ldquo;upgrade Django
to version 1.1 by running this command&rdquo;, you said, &ldquo;I want Django to
be at version 1.1&rdquo;. Subtle difference, but important.</p>
<p>Then came Kubernetes. In my opinion</p>
