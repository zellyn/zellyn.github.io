<p>It turns out we have several folks at Square who arrived at
programming through boot-camps, or other non-CS paths, and feel a sort
of lingering insecurity (or get explicitly told by unkind people) that
their path left them without a solid grasp of “the fundamentals”.</p>
<p>I have the pleasure of having a boot-camp grad on our team, <a href="https://amyh.dev/">Amy
Henning</a>: she&rsquo;s now several tech jobs in (and
fantastically capable), and has a great perspective on what our
industry can be like to people coming in from outside.</p>
<p>We decided to try an experiment for folks in our company interested in
learning CS: I&rsquo;ll play the grizzled veteran, and come up with
provocative questions, and we&rsquo;ll meet for an hour every two weeks and
discuss them. I&rsquo;m excited to see how it goes!</p>
<h2 id="encouragement">Encouragement</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the genesis of this ramble was trying to fill in
the gaps that cause bootcamp grads to feel shaky. There&rsquo;s an
interesting (and hopefully encouraging) thing about the stuff we&rsquo;re
going to cover: for many of the concepts, after learning, thinking,
and chatting about them for an hour or two, you&rsquo;ll be more comfortable
with them than many working programmers!</p>
<p>For every CS grad who spent entire classes working with 1s and 0s,
desigining circuits to add and manipulate binary numbers, there are
two more programmers who&rsquo;ve spent years working with simple web apps,
and never learned&mdash;or don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;how to twiddle bits. Even a
hand-wavy understanding of how the processor&rsquo;s use of memory affects
the speed at which your program executes will put you ahead of the
40%<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of all programmers for whom the CPU is just a complete
mystery.</p>
