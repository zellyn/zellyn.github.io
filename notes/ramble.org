* Feedback from Eric Ayers

** General feedback:

You've covered a lot of ground and I commend you for thinking this out.
I think that working with a mentor this would be a great resource.
Working on your own, it could be overwhelming.

*** TODO Could you provide some exercises?

*** DONE "simple web apps"
For the Intro, is saying "simple web apps" condescending to folks that
have created some great things, they just never have had to worry
about how JavaScript is implemented?

** Week 1a questions:

*** TODO How to find answers
How is someone out of bootcamp supposed to get answers to some of
these questions?  Are they supposed to research it?  Ask a friend?  Or
are you only expected to be able to answer these questions after the
next two posts?  If so, maybe say that up front?

** Week 1b - memory, text, numbers

*** TODO How do we pretend numbers are negative?  How Dad How?  (reading too much Berenstain Bears at the moment)

*** TODO 2 byte numbers
For bigger numbers, I have never seen the representation of 2 bytes as
two decimal numbers.  It's not necessarily wrong, but it kind of blows
my mind. I've been using hexadecimal too long.  would putting a header
on the blue column of numbers so you can show the first column is the
'256' column help?

*** TODO Types?
At the 'A note on names for things', would it help to briefly
introduce the concept of 'type' first? That's what everyone else will
call this.

*** TODO Too long?
Do you think that the variables post might cover too much ground? The
pointers topic is a really complicated one.  I remember folks at Tech
having a hard time getting their heads around it.  Languages don't
have explicit pointers anymore, but I agree the concept is important
to understand how memory is managed.

*** TODO Language dependence, overwhelming?
Text: Is the storage of text you give language dependent?  I think
this is a good example to use but maybe point out there are
differences in the text not just the footnote?  Is the description of
character encoding going to overwhelm the reader?

** Week 2b - Bases

I really like the odometers

*** TODO Prefixes
Do you think you should call out 'dec' as a prefix when you are using
decimal numbers in this example?  e.g. 256 *could* be octal, as they
haven't learned how to distinguish when written.

*** DONE Need a link to the 'next part' to easily navigate from this page

** Week 2c - Binary and Bits

*** TODO Is nibble spelled nibble or nybble? I've seen it both ways.
